Our project Drishti is basically a gesture to speech convertor. The general definition of gesture recognition is the ability of a computer to understand gestures and execute commands based on those gestures.

The reason for naming this project _Drishti_ is because we made the use of __"Drishti"__ of PCs and Computer Vision to recognize the hand gestures of the subject (in our case a person) and predict the cooresponding alphabet. We have also made the use of text to speech convertor to provide a voice enabled output.
### Input Data-
The input for this project is the [MNIST Gesture recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist).

The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion) and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows.

### Challenges :
- Creating a deep learning model for hand gesture classification. 
- Being able to extract and isolate the hand gestures  as images from OpenCV frames and apply the DL model to the images and return the frames.
- Using flask to create the web app for this project.
- Managing the version conflicts in anaconda.

### Dependencies -
- Python 3.8
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Keras
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PIL
- Matplotlib

### Steps to replicate the output :
Note : The steps have been mentioned keeping in mind that anaconda is installed on your machine.

- Since, we have made the use of very large input files; Therefore, please the type the following commands on git to ensure that the files are downloaded smoothly.
```
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.csv"
```
- Clone this repository using command.
```
git clone "https://github.com/DedSec-1/Drishti"
```
- Open anaconda Prompt and type the following commands to create a new environment and activate it. 
```
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.8
conda activate <env_name>
```
- Now the change the directory to the location of cloned directory using the following command.
```
cd <directory_path>
```
- Now install all the dependencies for this project using the command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 The dependencies should be installed without any error. If error occurs then manually install the libraries.
- Now run the following command to run the program
```
python main.py
```
If everything worked so far then you will be able to see something similar to : LOCALHOST:PORT or 0.0.0.0:8080 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/, etc.
- Copy and paste the link in the browser.
- The output should look like the one given below.
